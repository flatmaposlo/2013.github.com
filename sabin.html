  <p>
    Miles does stuff with Scala for Precog: currently he's working on the
    representation of the intermediate language between Quirrel (Precog's
    query language) and its various query/storage backends.
  </p>
  <p>
    When not working on Precog, he does his utmost to break Scalaâ€™s typechecker
    with his project shapeless and is a regular speaker at Scala and
    functional programming events. 
  </p>
  <p>
    He can often be found walking in the
    South Downs around his home in Brighton with a camera and an
    unfeasibly energetic English Springer Spaniel named Tigger.
