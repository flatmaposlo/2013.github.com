  <p>K책re Blakstad is a Scala-developer at FINN.no<http://FINN.no>, the Norwegian corporate equivalent of Craigslist. He usually works on the Scala core API's, but is sometimes forced to work on Java-projects. He tries to keep these disturbances to a minimum. K책re has been working with Scala for only about 6 months and this is some of the reason why he wants to share some of the early experiences with others debating whether or not to use this epic language.
  </p>
  <p>He is also a very eager beer brewer, and might have something to do with people getting a bit tipsy during flatMap 2013. Also, as you can see on the picture, he is extremely outdoorsy, and practically lives in the mountains.

  <h1>Building a Scala REST API - adaptation and experiences <small>Session</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
Faced with the "Classic" Java API - a sinkhole of hacks and technical debt - and the Finn veteran's deep lust to learn Scala, a new Scala REST API project was spawned. Consultants got hired, the coffee dispenser was filled and the task of creating a brand new API for some of the core functionality of the company was undertaken. This talk will deal with challenges associated with adapting a new programming paradigm in a OO/Java heavy organization, the side-effects that arose when throwing the old code out, choice of frameworks, performance issues and whatever else we have time to talk about.
