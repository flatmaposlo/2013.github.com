   Daniel Spiewak is a software developer based out of Boulder, CO. Over the years, he has worked with Java, Scala, Ruby, C/C++, ML, Clojure and several experimental languages. He currently spends most of his free time researching parser theory and methodologies, particularly areas where the field intersects with functional language design, domain-specific languages and type theory.

    Daniel has written a number of articles on his weblog, Code Commit, including his popular introductory series, Scala for Java Refugees.

  <h1>Living in a Post-Functional World <small>Keynote</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
  "Functional Programming" is the modern received wisdom regarding program and
  language design.  All the cool kids talk about writing code that is "functional"
  or even "purely functional".  However, functional programming as it is traditionally
  defined really doesn't cut the mustard, and if you look at how modern functional
  architectures are being shaped, everyone seems to have tacitly arrived at the
  same conclusion: more is needed.  
</p>
<p>  
  In this talk, we will look at how modern
  functional languages like Scala, Clojure and even Haskell have evolved beyond
  the simple paradigms of the lambda calculus.  We will see how the industry
  has really moved beyond functional programming and into the realm of something
  more powerful, more expressive and better suited to the task of large application
  architecture.

  <h1>Parsing A La Carte <small>Workshop</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
  Discover the deep mysteries of parsing algorithms and grammatical
  wizardry in everyone's favorite programming language! We will start
  from a basic parser combinator framework and build our way toward
  something much more general. Along the way, we will uncover the
  wonders of finite automata, parsing expression grammars,
  compiler-compilers, and more!
