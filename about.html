On the 15th and 16th of May 2012 a group of enthusiasts organised Norway's first dedicated Scala conference – flatMap(Oslo). We gathered some of those in the know in the Scala world, for two packed days of technical talks and workshops. It was a small success. In 2013 we gather again and aim for bigger and better! flatMap(Oslo) 2013 will include talks and workshops covering Scala and functional programming in general.

<p>
flatMap(Oslo) is organised by a group of developers from Arktekk – a small independent consultancy company based in Oslo, Norway. Our financial goal is to break even. Every penny we make will go into making the best possible conference. Together with our awesome sponsors we work hard to give you a conference tailored for enthusiasts of Scala and functional programming on the Java Virtual Machine.

Get in touch if you have any questions or comments. Maybe you realised your company's logo was missing from our list of sponsors!?
