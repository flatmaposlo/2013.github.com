  <h1>Sketching in Scala Notebook <small>Session</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
  Scala Notebook provides a new way of interacting with the language,
  a middle ground between the austerity of the text-mode REPL and the
  grandiosity of an IDE. The project, based on IPython Notebook,
  harnesses the REPL to a local HTTP server so that you can work with
  Scala in the most popular interface of our time â€” the web browser.
</p>
<p>
  What Scala Notebook hasn't had in its public form is a way to
  visualize data beyond HTML tables. This talk will explore a new fork
  of Scala Notebook that renders data in Scalable Vector Graphics, the
  standard visual language of the web. Going a step further, we'll
  leverage the popular D3 JavaScript library to smoothly manipulate
  SVG using live data from Scala Notebook cells.

  <h1>Setting HTTP Free with Unfiltered and Dispatch <small>Workshop</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
  Unfiltered and Dispatch are two independent libraries that are built
  with the same philosophy: HTTP libraries have no business telling
  you how to build your application. But in this workshop, we'll give
  you some ideas of how to do that.
</p>
<p>
  Jon-Anders Teigen and Nathan Hamblen will build and explain an
  Unfiltered web site that reflects current real-world conditions
  using web services accessed through Dispatch.
