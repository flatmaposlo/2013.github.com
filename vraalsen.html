Fredrik works as a software developer at Knowit, where he mainly deals in Java EE development. The last couple of years he's focused on functional programming and in particluar how to apply this in his daily job as a Java developer. He's held training courses in Scala and dabbled in Clojure, and likes to speak at conferences. </p>

  <h1>Java 8 to the rescue!? <small>Session</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
Java 8 will finally deliver us to the promised land of functional programming! So can we stop worrying now about learning Scala and Clojure and the other new kids on the block?
</p>
<p>
We'll look at what powers the new features such as Lambdas, Default Methods and Streams give us, as well as what Java is still lacking compared to other functional languages on the JVM.
