Jason Zaugg loved coding in Scala so much that he recently joined Typesafe to code <i>in</i> Scala. He's working on the compiler and standard library, in particular in the areas around macros and reflection. He's also been a core contributor to Scalaz and the IntelliJ Scala plugin.  </p>

  <h1>What's new in Scala 2.10? <small>Session</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
Scala 2.10 arrived in January, bringing with it some every day conveniences like the standardized Futures API, String Interpolation, Value Classes, and Implicit Classes,  along with the power features of Dynamic, Def Macros and Reflection. Learn how these features work together, and see how they are being used to provide the next generation of expressive, performance, and type safe libraries.

  <h1>Welcome to (Macro) Paradise <small>Workshop</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
  We'll examine macros in detail: when are they appropriate, how they
  are invoked by the compiler, and how you can implement them. This
  journey will take us from the standard Scala 2.10 release (which
  includes, experimentally, def-macros), through to the fabled "Macro
  Paradise," where R&D is underway to provide Type Macros and more.
</p>

<p>
  Concretely, we will:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learn how to reflect on types</li>
  <li>Use the REPL to experiment with compiler internals</li>
  <li>Build a macro, step-by-step, to transform a block of code</li>
  <li>Use reify, manual tree creation, and the new quasiquotes to construct and pattern match against trees.</li>
  <li>Learn what it means to be sym-ful</li>
  <li>Understand how to write (or use pre-written) tree Traversers and Transformers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic knowledge of git (or be sitting next to someone with said knowledge)</li>
  <li>You've at least browsed through http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/reflection/overview.html and the "Def Macros" section http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/overview.html</li>
  <li>SBT 0.12.3 installed (http://scala-sbt.org)</li>
</ul>
