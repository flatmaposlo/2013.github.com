  <p>
Jason Zaugg loved coding in Scala so much that he recently joined Typesafe to code <i>in</i> Scala. He's working on the compiler and standard library, in particular in the areas around macros and reflection. He's also been a core contributor to Scalaz and the IntelliJ Scala plugin.  </p>

  <h1>What's new in Scala 2.10? <small>Session</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
Scala 2.10 arrived in January, bringing with it some every day conveniences like the standardized Futures API, String Interpolation, Value Classes, and Implicit Classes,  along with the power features of Dynamic, Def Macros and Reflection. Learn how these features work together, and see how they are being used to provide the next generation of expressive, performance, and type safe libraries.

  <h1>Welcome to (Macro) Paradise <small>Workshop</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
Macros provide a way for your code to participate in the compilation project. The have garnered a huge amount of interest; many see them as our saviour from boilerplate, others fear them as a fast track to unmaintainable code.
</p>
<p>
  We'll examine macros in detail: when are they appropriate, how they are invoked by the compiler, and how you can implement them. This journey will take us from the standard Scala 2.10 release (which includes, experimentally, def-macros), through to the fabled "Macro Paradise", where R&amp;D is underway to provide Type Macros and more.
