  <p>
Daniel is a developer at Viaboxx, where he is building software for next-generation parcel machines using Java, Groovy and JavaScript. He has a long history with Java, dating back to the days of version 1.1, but grew passionate about functional programming several years ago. He helped create a cloud-based service for managing documents using Clojure and an architecture based on event sourcing and CQRS. He spends a lot of his free time with Scala, having contributed to several open-source projects.

  <h1>Event Sourcing for Functional Programmers <small>Workshop</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
Event Sourcing, CQRS and Memory Image are architectural patterns that often go hand in hand, and they have a strong following in the .NET community. Unfortunately, solutions found there and in existing Java frameworks follow a very object-oriented approach. However, the very ideas behind these patterns, especially event sourcing, are a natural fit for a functional programmer's mindset.
</p>
<p>
In this workshop, I will give an overview of the rationale behind employing these patterns and the tools we have available to implement them as functional programmers. This will be followed by a live coding session, in which we will build a small example application together, making use of the Eventsourced library for Scala and Akka.
