  Ross Lawley is a long term Pythonista and a newbie Scalaholic. As
  the maintainer of the 'Casbah' Scala Driver, Ross will discuss how
  much trouble an inquisitive look at the Functional Programming
  Principles in Scala course can get you into. Six months later and
  many lessons learnt, Ross now works on both Python and Scala MongoDB
  drivers for 10gen simultaneously. While introducing MongoDB, Ross
  will also look at the Scala Good Stuffâ„¢, as well as the bad, and
  look for ways to lower the learning curve.
