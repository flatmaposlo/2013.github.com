  <h1>What Every Hipster Should Know About Functional Programming <small>Session</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
  Different programming paradigms serve different purposes. Systems
  programmers prefer tools that are dumb, imperative and close to the
  metal. Enterprise programmers prefer tools which foster complexity,
  increasing billable hours and the client's dependency on the
  developer.
</p>
<p>
  And, let me just come clean and admit it, functional programmers do
  it for that delicious feeling of superiority that comes from looking
  down your nose at the normals in their caves banging together for
  loops and mutable state to make fire.
</p>
<p>
  Treat yourself to a crash course in the vocabulary of functional
  programming: higher order functions, combinators, the infinite
  opportunities to throw the word "monad" in the face of anyone who
  thinks an ironic moustache is enough to justify all that
  self-assured smugness these days. You'll never have to lose a
  programming argument again once you've learned where to casually
  toss terms like "applicative functor" and "Kleisli triple" into the
  conversation.
</p>
<p>
  This is the War of the Hipsters. Arm yourself now, before it goes
  mainstream.
