  <h1>Distributed Reactive Programming: Introducing Akka 2.2 <small>Session</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
  While asynchronous reactive programming is a great way to utilize multicore on one machine,
  distributed computing has the potential of providing more resilient systems and even more cores to use!
</p>
<p>
  In this talk we'll explore new features and changes in Akka 2.2 that will enable you to harness the computing power
  of multiple machines, get the most out of your CPUs, as well as integrate with existing software and services.
</p>
<p>
  Prepare for awesomeness! Bring popcorn!
