  Einar W. Høst is a developer and technical architect at Computas. Day time Einar heads his employer's internal Software Engineering network and holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Oslo. Night time Einar writes an obscure technical blog, enjoys pixel art, and indulges in impractical coding projects that are more geared towards satisfying curiosity and doing the unexpected than providing business value.

  <h1>Practical Lambda Calculus <small>Session</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
Jonas and Einar have a Socratic dialogue about the purest of the purest, the Lambda Calculus. Starting with just lambdas, Jonas will build up the basics of a programming language, in order to answer Einar's naïve questions about calculations, abstractions and programming in general. The explanations will be backed by live-coding in Jonas' home-brewed Sublime Text 2 plugin that does tricks on lambda expressions.
