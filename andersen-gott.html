  Morten fell in love with Scala in 2012, when he used it to build a pet project and discovered just how easy and enjoyable coding can be in Scala. Since then, he's been dreading the verbose nature of Java code. In his spare time, Morten is often seen wearing a referee kit, either on the football field or at developer conferences.

Jon-Anders and Morten will give you a short introduction to Scala, before we all start coding Scala. We will focus on an area that is the most fun for new Scala developers, the collections API. It tends to be an eye opener for Java developers, when they see just how easy and fun collections can be, in Scala.
