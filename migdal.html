  <h1>Latency and fault tolerance using Hystrix <small>Workshop</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
Many applications have external dependencies which eventually fail at
some point. E.g. an app calling 30 services with 99.9% naively will
theoretically have 97% uptime. The reality is usually much worse (latencies,
straglers, etc.).
</p>
<p>
The workshop will show how to use Scala with <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix">Hystrix</a> library to
isolate errors and improve the reliability in systematic manner. We
will be aiming to achieve maximal uptime and minimize latencies in
simulate environment.
</p>
<p>
Hystrix is a Java library, so you could use it also in other JVM languages
