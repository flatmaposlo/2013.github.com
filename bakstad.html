Erik is a former hockey player turned programmer, currently working at Miles. In his limited spare time he's working on a tool for documenting and visualizing system architecture, which they hope will be the same to Enterprise Architect as Git is to CVS.

  <h1>Composable Abstractions in Clojure <small>Session</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
  Most people agree that composabillity is a good thing, but few of us are used to working with or creating good composable abstractions. Why is that? I believe that the languages we use greatly influences the way we think, and if our languages encourage composabillity we are more likely to strive for it in our own programs.
</p>
<p>
  In this talk I will give examples of how first class- and higher order functions in Clojure helps us in create composable abstractions. I will also show how we can take existing APIs and make them more composable using core library functions.
</p>
<p>  
  Although the examples will be in Clojure, the same concepts applies to other languages that share the same functional idioms.
