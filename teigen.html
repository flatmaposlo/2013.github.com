  <h1>Setting HTTP Free with Unfiltered and Dispatch <small>Workshop</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
  Unfiltered and Dispatch are two independent libraries that are built
  with the same philosophy: HTTP libraries have no business telling
  you how to build your application. But in this workshop, we'll give
  you some ideas of how to do that.
</p>
<p>
  Jon-Anders Teigen and Nathan Hamblen will build and explain an
  Unfiltered web site that reflects current real-world conditions
  using web services accessed through Dispatch.
