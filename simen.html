    Having started his career as a Java developer, Simen went on to
    become co-founder and CEO of Iterate. Some might say that means
    Simen has joined the dark side - but he refuses to let go of his
    technical upbringing. His mixed career means that he takes an
    interest in business issues as well as technology, learning
    Organizational Analysis one month and Data Analysis with R the
    next month.

<p>
  For software companies in a tight employment market like the one in
  Norway, most technical advantages are dwarfed by one concern: Access
  to good developers. It clearly doesn't matter what kinds of
  technical advantages a new language can bring, if you can't hire any
  developers to work with it. On the flip side, if you can bring great
  developers to your project, you're probably in good shape no matter
  what language you have chosen.

<p>
  The data from 117 developers and hundreds of job listings shows that
  while employers want Java developers, developers want to work with
  Scala or Clojure.

  In this session I will start of by letting the numbers do the
  talking. Then the discussion will be open: Would businesses be wise
  to take advantage of my findings?
