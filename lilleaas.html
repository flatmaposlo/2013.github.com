  <p>
Works in Kodemaker as a consultant/contractor. Built a fairly large (and not yet publicly available) system in Clojure, using a mix of Datomic, elasticsearch and MongoDB, with AngularJS on the client. Likes building web systems in all shapes and sizes, and being involved in the entire stack. Prefers being called a UI programmer over front end developer. Has also written a bunch of Objective-C for iOS in previous jobs.

  <h1>WTF is Datomic? <small>Session</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
  Datomic is a new database with a twist on client/server and the change of data over time. For example, all data is immutable. And queries run on the client, not the server. Wat!!
  <ul class="large">
    <li>I'll tell you why (and when) that's a good thing.</li>
    <li>I'll introduce what Datomic is and how it works. Datomic is pretty different from most of the other databases out there. </li>
    <li>I'll explain how to use Datomic to store and query your data,</li>
    <li>I'll showcase some of the uses for datomic other than being the database in traditional server apps.</li>
  </ul>
