  <p>
  Bodil is a developer, frequent speaker and occasional teacher of web technology and anything that favours s-expressions. Her current obsession is development workflow, and her current experiment to that end is the Catnip editor for Clojure. She lives in Oslo, Norway in a wary relationship with her pet Roomba.
